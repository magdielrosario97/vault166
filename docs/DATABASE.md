# Vault 166 Database Enhancement

## Planned Enhancements

- Add SQLite persistence for game state.
- Support saving and loading from a named slot.
- Persist player state including current room, health, and inventory.
- Persist room state so picked up items do not respawn and notes do not reprint.
- Add basic validation and error handling to prevent corrupted saves from breaking gameplay.
- Document the database schema, relationships, and persistence workflow.
