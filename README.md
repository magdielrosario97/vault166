# Vault 166: Text-Based Survival Game

Vault 166 is a text-based survival game concept focused on exploration, environmental storytelling, and progression through a sealed underground vault. The project is inspired by the Fallout series and is designed to grow over time as new gameplay systems are introduced.

This README describes the narrative and design foundation of Vault 166. Some gameplay systems and mechanics outlined here are planned and will be implemented incrementally as the project evolves.

## Story Foundation

### Theme and Basic Storyline

Genre: Survival

In a nuclear wasteland, you are the first wanderer to come across Vault 166, a vault that has been sealed for over 50 years. Vault 166 was originally used for experimental research involving weapons, tools, and other resources. Over time, rumors began to surface about schematics capable of removing radiation entirely.

The vault was ultimately abandoned after an experiment went wrong. What remains inside is unstable, dangerous, and largely unexplored.

The player’s goal is to explore the vault, uncover what happened within its walls, and locate the schematics hidden deep inside.

### Design Intent

The game is designed around exploration and discovery rather than fast-paced action. Progression is intended to be driven by navigating the environment, uncovering information, and unlocking restricted areas through items and knowledge gained along the way. Gameplay systems are planned to be introduced gradually as the project expands.

## Vault Layout and Rooms

Vault 166 is structured around a central Atrium with multiple connected wings and restricted areas. The layout is designed to encourage exploration, backtracking, and a growing understanding of the vault’s history.

Planned rooms include:

- Vault Entrance
- Decontamination Room
- Storage Room
- Security
- Atrium
- Experimental Room
- Chemical Room
- Laboratory
- Medical Room
- Living Quarters
- Cafeteria
- Research & Development

Not all rooms or associated mechanics are implemented in the current build. This layout serves as the foundation for future development.

## Items

Items are intended to play a central role in progression and access throughout the vault. Many items are designed to unlock restricted areas or provide protection from environmental threats.

Planned items include:

- Flashlight
- ID Tag
- Keycard
- Mask
- HAZMAT Suit
- Fusion Core
- Schematics

Specific item behavior and interactions will be implemented as the game continues to evolve.

## Antagonist

Maradonyx

The collapse of Vault 166 is tied to a failed experiment that resulted in Maradonyx, a radiation-powered fusion entity sustained by the vault’s lingering contamination. Its existence explains both the abandonment of the vault and the dangers that remain inside.

Maradonyx serves primarily as a narrative anchor for the vault’s history and long-term threats. Details surrounding encounters or direct interaction are planned for later stages of development.

## Map Design

The following map represents the intended layout and structure of Vault 166. It acts as a reference for world design and progression planning rather than a direct reflection of current gameplay.
