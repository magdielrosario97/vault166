# Vault 166: Text-Based Survival Game

Create a game where players must survive in a
hostile environment, such as a post-apocalyptic world or a
deserted island, by managing resources, crafting tools, and
making critical choices.

Note: This project began as a simple, monolithic prototype. The baseline version represents the initial working implementation prior to any structural refactoring.
