### Scenario

You work for a small company that creates text-based games.
You have been asked to pitch an idea to your team for a
text-based adventure game with a theme and environment of
your choice. Your game must include different rooms, items,
and a villain. The basic gameplay will require the player to
move between different rooms to gather all the items.
A player wins the game by collecting all the items
before encountering the villain. The player will have two
options for commands in the game: moving to a different room,
and getting an item from the room they are in. Movement between
rooms happens in four simple directions: North, South, East, and
West.

You must include the designs for your game as a part of your idea
pitch. Specifically, you have been asked to provide a map that
displays the different rooms and items. You have also been asked
to use pseudocode or flowcharts to design code for moving between
rooms and getting items. If your pitch gets approved, these
designs will help your team members understand the pitch, and
will help the team develop the game in the future.
